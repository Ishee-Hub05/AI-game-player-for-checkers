# AI Game Player for Checkers ♟️
An intelligent AI-based Checkers game player developed using Python that applies classical game AI algorithms such as Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning and Reinforcement Learning to make optimal and strategic decisions during gameplay.  

✨ Features  
-Intelligent AI opponent for Checkers  
-Strategic move selection using Minimax algorithm  
-Optimized search using Alpha-Beta Pruning  
-Reinforcement Learning for adaptive gameplay  
-Heuristic-based board evaluation  
-Turn-based game simulation  
-Modular and readable Python code  

⚙️ How It Works  
-The game board is represented as a state.  
-Each possible move is treated as an action.  
-The AI evaluates future moves using the Minimax algorithm.  
-Alpha-Beta Pruning reduces unnecessary search paths for efficiency.  
-Reinforcement Learning allows the AI to learn from wins and losses.  
-The AI selects the move with the best evaluated outcome.  

🛠️ Technologies Used  
-Python  
-Minimax Algorithm  
-Alpha-Beta Pruning  
-Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)  
-Heuristic Evaluation Functions  

🎯 Learning Objectives  
-Understand game state representation and search trees  
-Implement Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms  
-Apply Reinforcement Learning concepts in games  
-Learn heuristic evaluation of board positions  
-Gain hands-on experience with AI decision-making systems
